I'll provide you a link to a Notion issue and point you to this place. You will
do this:

1. Do a git pull from main to ensure latest changes are here.
2. Fetch and read the Notion task.
3. Create a new branch and worktree under ~/worktrees/pf-app/ with a meaningful
   name.
4. Copy over the `ralph.yml`.
5. Copy over the `PROMPT.md`.
6. Copy the text in the issue as `INITIAL.md`.

Ask no questions about doing this. Do.
