## Requirement

incomplete. Statements flagged this way should receive a 'manual-review' tag.

### Details

- Detect statements that may contain errors or are incomplete
- Add a visible visual indicator on those statements in the UI
- Apply a 'manual-review' tag to flagged statements
- Allow users to quickly identify which statements need attention
